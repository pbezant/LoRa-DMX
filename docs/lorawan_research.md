# LoRaWAN Class C Examples Research for Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 v3.2

## Updated Research (2024)

### Summary of Findings
- There are **no plug-and-play, well-documented, open-source projects** on GitHub that use the Heltec V3 board as a Class C LoRaWAN device out of the box.
- The **official Heltec library** ([HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32](https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32)) is currently broken for V3 in PlatformIO/Arduino (missing defines, build errors, typos). Class C is supported in theory, but not well documented or maintained for V3.
- The **best, most modern, and actively maintained option** is the [ropg/heltec_esp32_lora_v3](https://github.com/ropg/heltec_esp32_lora_v3) library, used with [LoRaWAN_ESP32](https://github.com/ropg/LoRaWAN_ESP32) and [RadioLib](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib). This stack is community-driven, reliable, and easier to debug/extend. RadioLib supports Class C, and the examples can be adapted for it.
- Other forks/ports (e.g., [eiannone/Heltec_Esp32_LoRaWan](https://github.com/eiannone/Heltec_Esp32_LoRaWan)) exist, but are either not focused on Class C or are less maintained.

### Project Recommendations
- **Recommended:** Use `ropg/heltec_esp32_lora_v3` + `LoRaWAN_ESP32` + RadioLib for a maintainable, modern Class C LoRaWAN device on Heltec V3. Adapt the `LoRaWAN_TTN` example for Class C operation.
- **Not recommended:** The official Heltec library for V3, due to current build issues and lack of up-to-date Class C examples.

## API Investigation (RadioLib LoRaWANNode - 2024 Update)

Based on direct inspection of the `RadioLib/src/protocols/LoRaWAN/LoRaWAN.h` header file (as of current library version):

*   **Primary Uplink/Downlink Method:** The main method for LoRaWAN communication appears to be `sendReceive(const uint8_t* dataUp, size_t lenUp, uint8_t fPort, uint8_t* dataDown, size_t* lenDown, bool isConfirmed, LoRaWANEvent_t* eventUp, LoRaWANEvent_t* eventDown)`.
*   **Synchronous Operation:** This method is synchronous. It sends an uplink and then listens for a potential downlink within the RX1/RX2 windows or a short period afterward for Class C. It does not block indefinitely.
*   **Downlink Handling:** Downlinks are primarily received as part of this `sendReceive` call. If a downlink arrives in response to an uplink, the provided `dataDown` buffer is populated.
*   **No Clear Asynchronous Downlink Callback:** The public API of `LoRaWANNode` does not expose a straightforward function pointer or virtual method to register an asynchronous callback that would be triggered by an unsolicited downlink (i.e., a downlink not immediately following an uplink from the device).
*   **Class C Implications:** While the SX1262 chip and RadioLib's lower layers support continuous receive for Class C, the high-level `LoRaWANNode` API does not seem to offer a simple "true Class C" event-driven model for downlinks. To receive downlinks at arbitrary times, the application might need to:
    *   Periodically call `sendReceive` (potentially with an empty uplink payload) to poll for messages.
    *   Investigate if lower-level RadioLib receive functions can be used in conjunction with `LoRaWANNode` for more direct control over the receive window after initial activation.
*   **Event Loop:** There is no explicit `loop()` or `update()` method in the `LoRaWANNode` public API that needs to be called for routine processing. The library seems to handle its state internally during the `sendReceive` calls and radio events.
*   **Join/Activation:**
    *   `int16_t beginOTAA(uint64_t joinEUI, uint64_t devEUI, const uint8_t* nwkKey, const uint8_t* appKey);`
    *   `int16_t activateOTAA(uint8_t initialDr = RADIOLIB_LORAWAN_DATA_RATE_UNUSED, LoRaWANJoinEvent_t *joinEvent = NULL);`
    *   `bool isActivated();`

**Next Steps for True Class C:**
The immediate next step is to thoroughly examine the examples provided with the `RadioLib` and `LoRaWAN_ESP32` libraries. These examples might demonstrate:
1.  A specific pattern for initializing and using `LoRaWANNode` in Class C that enables more responsive downlink handling.
2.  Use of lower-level RadioLib APIs to achieve continuous listen and event-driven downlinks for Class C, potentially bypassing or supplementing the `LoRaWANNode::sendReceive` polling pattern.
3.  If examples don't reveal a clear path, alternative strategies like a carefully managed polling uplink or even subclassing `LoRaWANNode` (if virtual methods for event handling exist but are not obvious) would need to be considered. 

## Additional LoRaWAN Class C Examples (2024 Update)

Based on our latest research, we've found several additional examples of Class C implementations that might be useful:

### 1. RadioLib LoRaWAN Implementation
The official RadioLib library has comprehensive LoRaWAN support, including Class C operation. Their approach uses:
- Standard uplink/downlink with `sendReceive()`
- Setting device class via configuration
- Using the same API for both Class A and Class C devices

While the library supports Class C operation, the API doesn't expose a direct asynchronous downlink callback mechanism. Instead, you need to:
- Call a method like `sendReceive()` or similar to check for pending downlinks
- Build a polling mechanism around this API
- Implement your own state management for asynchronous operation

### 2. GereZoltan/LoRaWAN MicroPython Implementation
This repository contains a complete MicroPython LoRaWAN implementation for SX1262:
- Includes full Class C support with continuous receive mode
- Uses interrupt-based downlink detection
- Implements callback mechanism for asynchronous downlink processing
- The code could be ported to C++ for our ESP32 environment

### 3. nopnop2002 Libraries
Two libraries from nopnop2002 provide well-documented examples for our specific hardware:
- **esp-idf-sx126x**: ESP-IDF native driver for SX1262/SX1268/LLCC68
- **Arduino-LoRa-Ra01S**: Arduino library specifically for Ra-01S/Ra-01SH modules

These examples focus on the hardware specifics of the SX1262 chip and might provide better compatibility with our Heltec board than the generic RadioLib implementation.

### 4. EBYTE Module Examples
The examples for EBYTE modules with SX1262 show that some chips require explicit use of TXEN and RXEN pins that need to be separately controlled. This might be relevant to our implementation as well.

## Proposed Architecture for Our Class C Implementation

Based on our findings, here's a proposed approach for implementing a robust Class C device:

1. **Base Layer**: Use RadioLib's LoRaWAN implementation or nopnop2002's library as the foundation
2. **Extension Layer**: 
   - Implement an interrupt-driven receive mechanism similar to GereZoltan's approach
   - Add a dedicated thread or task for monitoring downlinks
   - Implement a callback system for processing received data
3. **Application Layer**:
   - Provide a simple API for sending uplinks and registering downlink handlers
   - Handle session persistence using ESP32's non-volatile storage
   - Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

This approach would combine the best aspects of the various implementations we've found, while addressing the specific requirements of a Class C device.
