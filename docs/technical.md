# Technical Specifications and Established Patterns

This document details technical specifications for various aspects of the project and outlines established coding patterns and practices.

## Coding Standards

*   **Language Version(s):** C++ (Arduino flavor, typically based on a recent C++ standard like C++11 or C++17 depending on ESP-IDF version used by PlatformIO for ESP32)
*   **Linting & Formatting:** (Not explicitly defined in `platformio.ini`, but PlatformIO can integrate with tools like ClangFormat. Assume default or user-configured.)
*   **Naming Conventions:** (Likely Arduino/C++ conventions, e.g., camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes/structs, UPPER_CASE for constants/macros. To be confirmed by inspecting source code.)

## Established Patterns

### Pattern A: Wrapper Libraries for Hardware Abstraction

*   **Description:** Custom libraries (`LoRaManager`, `DmxController` mentioned in README) are used to simplify interaction with underlying hardware/communication libraries (`RadioLib`, `esp_dmx`). This provides a cleaner API for the main application logic and encapsulates hardware-specific details.
*   **When to Use:** When interacting with complex external libraries or hardware peripherals to provide a simplified and project-specific interface.
*   **Example (or link to example code):**
    ```cpp
    // Conceptual example based on README description
    // LoRaManager lora;
    // lora.joinNetwork(joinEUI, devEUI, appKey);
    // if (lora.messageReceived()) { /* process message */ }

    // DmxController dmx;
    // dmx.setChannel(1, 255);
    ```

### Pattern B: JSON for Dynamic Configuration/Commands

*   **Description:** JSON payloads received over LoRaWAN are parsed to dynamically control DMX fixtures. This avoids hardcoding fixture settings and allows flexible remote configuration.
*   **When to Use:** For sending structured data or commands to the device, especially when the parameters can vary.
*   **Example (or link to example code):** (See JSON command format in `README.md`)

## API Specifications

*   **Primary Interface:** LoRaWAN Downlink Messages via The Things Network (TTN)
*   **Payload Format:** JSON (see `README.md` for structure). Also supports simplified text/numeric commands via TTN payload formatter.
*   **Authentication:** OTAA (Over-The-Air Activation) for LoRaWAN network join. AppKey provides device authentication.
*   **TTN Payload Formatter:** `ttn_payload_formatter.js` (JavaScript) used in TTN console to decode uplink and encode downlink messages.

## Security Considerations

*   **LoRaWAN Security:** Relies on standard LoRaWAN security mechanisms (AES-128 encryption for network and application sessions).
*   **Credential Management:** `joinEUI`, `devEUI`, and `appKey` are critical for network access. `README.md` indicates these are in `main.cpp` and should be user-configured.
*   **Input Sanitization:** (Assumed to be handled by `ArduinoJson` during parsing, but complex or malformed JSON could still be a concern. Further inspection of parsing logic in source code needed.)

## Performance Guidelines

*   **Real-time DMX:** DMX requires consistent timing. `esp_dmx` library likely handles this at a low level.
*   **LoRaWAN Duty Cycle:** Adherence to LoRaWAN regional duty cycle limitations is critical (managed by `RadioLib` and TTN).
*   **JSON Parsing:** `ArduinoJson` is generally efficient, but very large/complex JSON payloads could impact performance or memory on the microcontroller. Payload size is also limited by LoRaWAN constraints.
*   **Power Consumption:** For battery-powered applications (if any), deep sleep and minimizing radio transmission time are important. (Heltec LoRa 32 V3 has Wi-Fi/Bluetooth which should be disabled if not used to save power). 

## Dynamic Number of Lights Configuration (Config Downlink)

- The device now supports dynamic configuration of the number of DMX lights it controls.
- By default, the device is set to control 25 lights (the maximum supported in a single LoRaWAN downlink).
- You can change this at runtime by sending a config downlink: `{ "config": { "numLights": N } }` (where N is 1â€“25).
- The ChirpStack codec encodes this as `[0xC0, N]`.
- The firmware receives this payload, sets the number of lights, re-initializes fixtures, and confirms via serial output and a 4-blink LED pattern.
- This allows remote reconfiguration of the DMX fixture count without reflashing or rebooting the device.
