# LoRaWAN Join Troubleshooting Log

## Device Details
- **Device:** Heltec LoRa 32 V3
- **Firmware:** Official Heltec LoRaWAN Library
- **Region:** US915

## Gateway Details
- **Model:** Dragino LPS8
- **Region:** US915

## Problem Statement
The device attempts to join the network using OTAA activation but fails to receive a join accept. The device is using the official Heltec LoRaWAN library with direct SX126x radio driver integration.

## Initial Checks (Completed)
- **LoRaWAN Credentials:** Defined in `include/secrets.h`:
  ```cpp
  // Device EUI
  DEVEUI: "522b03a2a79b1d87"
  
  // Application EUI
  APPEUI: "27ae8d0509c0aa88"
  
  // Application/Network Key
  APPKEY/NWKKEY: "2d6fb7d54929b790c52e66758678fb2e"
  ```
  These credentials are confirmed to match between device firmware and ChirpStack.
- **Region:** Confirmed US915 for device, gateway, and ChirpStack.
- **Device Antenna:** Confirmed securely connected.

## Next Investigation Steps

**UPDATE (Timestamp): Gateway does NOT see packets from the problematic Heltec device, but DOES see packets from other known-good devices. This shifts focus to the Heltec device itself or its direct RF link to the gateway.**

1.  **Verify Gateway Reception & Forwarding:**
    *   ~~Check Dragino LPS8 gateway logs for incoming LoRa packets from the problematic device's DevEUI.~~ (DONE - Gateway does not see packets from this device)
    *   ~~Check ChirpStack gateway's "Live LoRaWAN Frames" or equivalent section to see if join requests from this DevEUI are being received by ChirpStack.~~ (Skipping as gateway sees nothing)

2.  **ChirpStack Device Status & Events:**
    *   In ChirpStack, check the device's "Events" or "Frames" tab to see if any join requests are logged and what the outcome is (e.g., "MIC mismatch", "DevNonce already used").
    *   Verify the device profile and application settings in ChirpStack are correct for US915 and OTAA.

3.  **US915 Channel Configuration:**
    *   Verify the channel mask settings in platformio.ini match the gateway configuration:
    ```ini
    build_flags =
        -D LORAWAN_REGION_US915_CHANNELS_MASK=0xFF00
        -D LORAWAN_REGION_US915_CHANNELS_DEFAULT_MASK=0xFF00
        -D LORAWAN_REGION_US915_CHANNELS_EXTRA_MASK=0x0002
    ```

## Focused Troubleshooting for Heltec Device:

1.  **Physical Verification (Critical Priority):**
    *   **Antenna Type:** Confirm antenna is specifically for US915 (902-928 MHz). Mismatched antennas (e.g., 2.4GHz WiFi antenna) will severely degrade performance.
    *   **Antenna Connection:** Re-verify U.FL or SMA connector is secure and properly seated. Inspect for any damage to connector or cable.
    *   **Proximity Test:** Move the Heltec device within 1-3 meters (3-10 feet) of the Dragino LPS8 gateway. This minimizes range/obstruction issues. Observe LPS8 logs during join attempts.
    *   **RF Interference:** Ensure Heltec device is not near strong RF noise sources (WiFi routers, microwaves, other transmitters) during testing.

2.  **Firmware Configuration:**
    *   **Library Version:** Verify using latest Heltec ESP32 Dev-Boards library
    *   **Board Selection:** Confirm correct board selection in platformio.ini:
        ```ini
        [env:heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3]
        platform = espressif32
        board = heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3
        ```
    *   **LoRaWAN Parameters:** Check initialization sequence in main.cpp matches Heltec's example code:
        ```cpp
        Mcu.begin();
        LoRaWAN.init(loraWanClass, loraWanRegion);
        ```

3.  **Debug Output:**
    *   Enable detailed debug output:
        ```ini
        build_flags =
            -D CORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=3
        ```
    *   Monitor serial output for specific join request timing and parameters

## Next Steps:
1. Implement proper error handling for join failures
2. Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff
3. Consider implementing a watchdog reset if join fails after multiple attempts
4. Add detailed logging of radio parameters during join attempts
