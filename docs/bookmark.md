# LoRa-DMX Project: Refactoring Summary

## Completed Changes

1. **Rebuilt LoRaWANManager Class**
   - Implemented singleton pattern for global access via `getInstance()`
   - Eliminated raw pointer management with static instance
   - Improved memory usage by replacing string-based key storage with byte arrays
   - Added comprehensive event notification system with callback support

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added watchdog timer resets at critical initialization points
   - Improved error detection and reporting throughout the codebase
   - Added error event notifications for join and transmission failures

3. **Technical Improvements**  
   - Better SX1262 radio initialization and pin management
   - Fixed channel setup for US915 and AU915 regions
   - Improved Class C continuous reception configuration
   - More reliable OTAA join procedure

4. **Configuration Updates**
   - Updated LMIC project configuration for better compatibility
   - Synchronized configuration between src and include directories
   - Added improved debugging capabilities

## Pending Issues

1. **Linter Errors to Fix**:
   - `LoRaWANManager.cpp`: Duplicate case value for `EV_JOIN_FAILED`
   - `main.cpp`: 'downlinkCounter' not declared in scope (line 931)
   - `main.cpp`: 'response' not declared in scope (line 1579)
   - `lmic_project_config.h`: 'LMIC_setupClassC' not declared in scope (needs #ifdef)

2. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Complete hardware testing with actual SX1262 radio
   - Verify join process and transmission reliability
   - Confirm proper Class C operation for downlink reception

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Fix remaining linter errors
   - Implement more robust error recovery for radio failures
   - Enhance documentation with usage examples
   - Consider adding power saving features for battery operation

## Implementation Notes

The new implementation follows modern C++ practices including the singleton pattern, proper memory management, and event-driven architecture. This should significantly improve stability on ESP32 with SX1262 radios by addressing the watchdog timeout issues that were occurring during initialization and operation.
