# SX1262 Bandwidth Testing Tool

This tool tests all possible bandwidths supported by the SX1262 chip on the Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3.2 board. It's part of our implementation of a hybrid approach using nopnop2002's SX1262 driver with RadioLib's LoRaWAN stack to achieve true Class C operation.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this tool is to identify which bandwidths are compatible with our specific hardware. This information is crucial for:

1. Determining which bandwidths to use in our LoRaWAN implementation
2. Implementing a proper bandwidth detection and fallback mechanism
3. Resolving the persistent INVALID_BANDWIDTH errors encountered in previous implementation attempts

## Hardware Setup

This tool is designed for the Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3.2 board with the SX1262 chip. No additional hardware is required beyond the board itself.

## Usage

1. Build and upload the tool to your Heltec board
2. Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud
3. The test will run automatically and display results on both the OLED display and serial monitor
4. Document which bandwidths are supported for use in the main implementation

## Tested Bandwidths

The tool tests the following bandwidths (in kHz):
- 7.8
- 10.4
- 15.6
- 20.8
- 31.25
- 41.7
- 62.5
- 125.0
- 250.0
- 500.0

## How It Works

The tool:
1. Initializes the SX1262 radio using nopnop2002's Ra01S driver
2. Attempts to set each bandwidth sequentially
3. Records which bandwidths are successfully set (return code 0)
4. Performs an additional SPI register test to verify proper hardware communication
5. Displays comprehensive results on both the OLED display and serial monitor

## Integration with Our Project

The results from this tool will inform our implementation of:
1. The bandwidth detection and fallback mechanism in our LoRaWANHelper
2. The appropriate RX2 parameters for Class C continuous reception
3. The US915 band configuration in our LoRaWAN implementation

## Next Steps

After identifying compatible bandwidths:
1. Update the implementation plan with the specific bandwidths to use
2. Implement the bandwidth detection and fallback mechanism in the integration layer
3. Configure the Class C continuous reception to use compatible bandwidths
